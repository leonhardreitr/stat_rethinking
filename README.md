# stat_rethinking
My notes and solutions to Richard McElreath's amazing Book "[Statistical Rethinking](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/)".
Heavily inspired by [Solomon Kurz's](https://bookdown.org/content/4857/) tidyverse + brms translation, as well as [Jake Thompson's solutions](https://sr2-solutions.wjakethompson.com/index.html)

Not really intended to be useful for anyone, but I like to code in public
